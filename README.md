### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm learning to build web applications. I have started learning HTML - CSS - Javascript on my own and following tutorials. I have just finished a full stack web developer bootcamp.

I have worked on an e-commerce for wine products. This was the final project of the bootcamp, made with 7 other developers. 
For this project I worked on the back-end, and we decided to learn Mongo db, Mongoose and Typescript.
You can check the project out at: https://voluble-hummingbird-3fb9b1.netlify.app/

Currently I am practicing TYPESCRIPT.
